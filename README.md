This repository contains 100 Python projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels. 

These projects were initially assigned as part of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). 

However, I have made my own modifications to enhance their interactivity and make them more engaging.
